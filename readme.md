# JavaScript Sorting Visualizer

This is a JavaScript sorting visualizer that demonstrates the bubble sort algorithm using dummy data. It provides a visual representation of the sorting process.


## Usage

To use this sorting visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The visualizer will generate a set of bars with random heights.

4. The bars will start sorting using the bubble sort algorithm. Each comparison between bars is highlighted.

5. Wait for the sorting process to complete. The bars will be rearranged in ascending order based on their heights.

## Customization

You can customize the sorting visualizer by modifying the code. Here are some possible modifications:

- **Number of Bars**: You can change the number of bars generated by modifying the `NUM_BARS` variable in the JavaScript code.
